    "In terms of the differences,\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are modern, open-source, high productivity languages with all the key features needed for\n",
    "high-performance computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia has the advantage that third party libraries are often written entirely in Julia itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has the advantage of being supported by a vast collection of scientific libraries (and being a highly marketable skill)."

    "## Open Source\n",
    "\n",
    "All the computing environments we work with are free and open-source.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you, your coauthors and your students can install them and their libraries on all of your computers without cost or concern about licenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of open source libraries is that you can read them and learn\n",
    "how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s say you want to know exactly how [statsmodels](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels) computes Newey-West covariance matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "No problem: You can go ahead and [read the code](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/blob/master/statsmodels/stats/sandwich_covariance.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "While dipping into external code libraries takes a bit of coding maturity, it’s very useful for\n",
    "\n",
    "1. helping you understand the details of a particular implementation, and  \n",
    "1. building your programming skills by showing you code written by first-rate programmers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you can modify the library to suit your needs: if the functionality provided is not exactly what you want, you are free to change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another, a more philosophical advantage of open-source software is that it conforms to the [scientific ideal of reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)."
